# Task1 W
**Compile statistics on the age structure of students in our group.Draw 1000 age values and these should be distributed 
in the same way as the age distribution of the students in the group. How do you do it? Explain the algorithm in enough 
details to be able to program it directly.**

- Create a cumulative distribution table for age and cumulative %.
- Initialize an array to store counts for each age.
- Repeat 1000 times:
    a. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    b. Compare the random number to the cumulative % table.
    c. Assign the age corresponding to the first cumulative % â‰¥ random number.
    d. Increment the counter for that age in the array.

- After 1000 iterations, the generated ages approximate the specified distribution.
- Optionally, calculate and print the percentage of each age.

# Task 3

**(W) Why can't a Singleton object be created from outside the Singleton class using the new operation?**
- Because  Singleton design pattern is specifically designed where only one instance of class can exist. Also,the 
constructor is private which is accessed through a public static method like getInstance().


# Task 4

**Familiarize yourself with a few distributions that could be used in the simulator for experimentation**

1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian) : Symmetric, bell-shaped curve around the mean. Most values cluster near the average; extreme values are rare.

- Use in simulations: Modeling natural variations or measurement errors.

- Real-life examples:

- Height of People: Most are average height; very tall or short are rare.

- Rolling Dice: Sums of multiple dice rolls form a bell-shaped distribution.

- Tossing a Coin: Multiple tosses approximate 50% heads.

2. Poisson Distribution : Counts the number of rare events happening in a fixed interval of time or space.
- Use in simulations: Modeling random arrivals or occurrences over time.
- Examples: Number of customers arriving at a bank per hour, number of calls at a call center.

        // Verify that both references point to the same object
        System.out.println("Both instances are the same: " + (clock == anotherClock));
